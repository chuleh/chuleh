# Hi there! I'm Leandro (but everyone calls me chuleh)

## **About me** 👇🏻

- 📍 I was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina 🇦🇷 - However, I code all over the globe (remote working perks)
- 🧾 I've been coding and breaking stuff since I had my first computer: an **HP Vectra 486** (I believe it was 1993?)
- 🐧 My first Linux distro (and still favorite) was Slackware 7
- 📝 My favorite text editor is *vim* - I preach the *vim* word everywhere I go
  - If you check my repos you can see lots of vim configs I've used over the years

## **Stuff I'm currently doing**

- 🧑🏻‍💻 Working [@apollo.io](https://apollo.io) as a 🔐 Cloud Security Engineer
- 🎥 I've learned a few things over the years so I'm recording that to be uploaded and delivered as courses -will update within this year-
- 🎸 I play guitar every single day of my life - I have recorded some (lousy) stuff. Some day I'll share

## **🔐 What about my security knowledge?**

I've done my fair share of pentestesting over the years. However, due to NDA's signed I can't publicly share that data.
Having said this, I know quite thoroughly my way around tools suchs as:

- BurpSuite
- Owasp ZAP
- metasploit framework
- nuclei

➡ not mentioning basic stuff as nmap, wp-scan, ncat, socat, shodan and such.

- Also, wish I had more time to play hackthebox but my job comes first 😓

## **📖 Certifications?**

- To be fair  I have a few and if you browse my repos you can find notes I took while I was studying for them.
Truth be told I never renewed them.
